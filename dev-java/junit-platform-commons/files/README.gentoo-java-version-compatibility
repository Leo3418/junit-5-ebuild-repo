Because JDK >=9 was used to build this package, source files using
classes from Java SE API that are only available since Java 9 were
compiled.  Since these classes are not present on Java 8, the JARs
built by this package are incompatible with Java 8.

To use this package with Java 8, it must be rebuilt using JDK 8.
